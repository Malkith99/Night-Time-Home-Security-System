+------------+
|  Data Input |
+------------+
This step involves inputting the raw images of cats and dogs that will be used to train and evaluate the model.




+---------------+
| Image Pre-processing |
+---------------+
This step involves pre-processing the images to prepare them for training and evaluation. This could include tasks such as:

Resizing the images to a standard size
Converting the images to grayscale
Normalizing the pixel values
Augmenting the data to increase the size of the training set



+--------------+
| Model Definition |
+--------------+
This step involves defining the model, which includes selecting the architecture, loss function, optimizer, and metrics to evaluate the model.



+--------------+
| Model Training |
+--------------+
This step involves training the model on the pre-processed images. During training, the model will learn the features and patterns in the data that differentiate between cats and dogs.



+--------------+
| Model Evaluation |
+--------------+
This step involves evaluating the model on a separate set of pre-processed images to measure its accuracy. The metrics selected in the Model Definition step will be used to evaluate the model.




+--------------+
| Model Deployment |
+--------------+
This step involves deploying the trained model and using it to classify new images as cats or dogs.




+------------+
| Results |
+------------+
This step involves outputting the results of the classification, which could be the predicted labels of cats or dogs for the input images.
